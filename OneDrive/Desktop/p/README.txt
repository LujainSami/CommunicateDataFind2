The  project have two parts which illustrates the value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process and why is it important.
Firstt part,  I used Python visualization libraries to explore a dataset that was selected, 
I started from the plots of one variables and I build up  plots of multiple variables. 
 Second part,  I illustrate interesting properties, 
trends, and relationships that you discovered  a selected dataset. 
The primary method  that conveyed  the findings  through transforming  the exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
